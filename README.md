# Multi-center-multi-device-Retinal-OCT-dataset-with-RPE-deliniation

In this study, we used a dataset of 3173 OCT images from healthy and abnormal subjects Images acquired using different OCT devices. We divided these images into six subsets as described in Table I. 
Subset I consisted of 1568 images from healthy subjects and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) obtained by the Heidelberg OCT platform (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). This subset has been presented in [1]. Subset II is composed of 116 images from abnormal cases (AMD pathology).This dataset has been acquired from the spectral domain (SD-OCT) imaging system from Bioptigen, Inc (Research Triangle Park, NC) and has been utilized in [2]. Subset III is acquired from a Custom-made swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) imaging system designed and built in Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Basel. This dataset consists of 45 subjects without eye pathologies collected in Didavaran eye clinic, Isfahan, Iran. This subset has been used in [3], [4]. Subset IV has also been used in [5] and contains thirteen 3D macular SD-OCT images obtained from eyes without pathologies using Topcon 3D OCT-1000 imaging system in Ophthalmology Department, Feiz Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Subset V consists of 63 images with a resolution of 1024x960 pixels obtained at the Farabi Eye Hospital's Retinal Service Center in Tehran, Iran from 30 patients with a variety of eye pathologies. This subset hasbeen used in [6]. Subset VI is studied in [7] and consists of 193 OCT images from 19 DME patients. This dataset has been acquired from the Heidelberg system version 5.1.
